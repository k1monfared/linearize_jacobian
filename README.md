# Linearize Jacobian

The following code takes a function f that maps R^2 to R^2 and draws three regions:

1. the unit cube in blue,
2. the image of the unit cube under f in red, and
3. the linearization of the image by Jacobian of f at the origin

While showing this to students I choose the function in a way that origin is mapped to origin for simplicity.
